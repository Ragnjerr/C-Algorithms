# C-Algorithms
The creme del a creme of languages that I finally ported to...
Seriously, I shit you not, I am really proud I ported my Fibonacci Sequencer from Gforth, to PL/0, to Pascal then to C.  It took a lot of study and patience for me to learn C (I also suffer learning disabilities that make it harder to learn languages like C), and guess what, it paid off!!!  More algorithms to come.  And for those that find programming hard, trust me, with time and patience and tenacity and stubborness, you too can write in C!!!
